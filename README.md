# ProjetParaworld

This is a personal project close to my heart. The Paraworld video game was my very first computer game. Being in professional retraining in the field of java programming, I wanted to create this project both in order to train myself and potentially recreate this game with my hands.

Paraworld on PC is a real-time strategy game that allows you to create armies with ferocious dinosaurs. Equip them with powerful weapons and go into battle. Choose from 3 factions: the Dust Horsemen, the Dragon Clan and the Northern Men. Discover 15 different maps and climatic zones, 90 units to manage and a multi mode rich option.

ParaWorld is a real-time strategic game produced by the German development studio SEK and released by Sunflowers.
